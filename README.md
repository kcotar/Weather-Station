# 4. Home automation
A system that shares some of the components (power source, display etc.) with the weather station and is used to control some hardware parts (lights, sensors) of the room. Components are driven by a simple IR remote. Capability of alarm clock that automaticaly turns on ligths in the room and piezo buzzer and uses them as a way to wake up the person sleeping in the room.<br />
